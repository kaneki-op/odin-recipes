  <h3>Butter chicken, traditionally known as <em>murgh makhani</em> 
     is an Indian dish originating in Delhi.
     It is a type of curry made from chicken with a spiced tomato and butter (makhan) sauce. 
     Its sauce is known for its rich texture. It is similar to chicken tikka masala, 
     which uses a tomato paste.
