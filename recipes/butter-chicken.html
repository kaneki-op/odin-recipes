  <h1><u>Butter-Chicken</u></h1>  
  <h3>Butter chicken, traditionally known as murgh makhani 
     is an Indian dish originating in Delhi.
     It is a type of curry made from chicken with a spiced tomato and butter (makhan) sauce. 
     Its sauce is known for its rich texture. It is similar to chicken tikka masala, 
     which uses a tomato paste.
